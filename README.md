# Sounds-of-Sorting

The main goal when building this program was to show both a **audibilizer** and **visualizer** for six sorting algorithms. This is achieved by playing MIDI notes for an unsorted scale and then visually showing their sorting according to the respective algorithm used. 

## Sorting Algorithms

The sorting algorithms that I chose to use are as follows:

- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort (more information at [references](https://github.com/karkipra/Sounds-of-Sorting#references))

## Features

This program illustrates a visceral method of showing the workings behind these common sorting algorithms. Furthermore, these algorithms are implemented on two types of scales: **chromatic** and **pentatonic**. As any music lover should know, a chromatic scale encompasses all standard 12 notes per octave, while a pentatonic scale operates only on 5 notes per octave.

Moreover,
